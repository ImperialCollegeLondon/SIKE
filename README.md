# SIKE

SIKE (Scrape-off layer Impurities with Kinetic Electrons) solves the density evolution equations for a given set of impurity atomic states. Inputs are either:

1. Electron temperature and density arrays
2. Data from a SOL-KiT simulation, including electron distribution functions evolved according to the Vlasov-Fokke-Planck equation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2020.107600)
