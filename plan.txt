Done
- Add to setup.py: download atomic data from Zenodo and put somewhere sensible
- Finish sorting docstrings and type hints in transition.py (got up to ExTrans, next one to do is IzTrans)

To do
- Provide a config file API as well as/instead of python API to launch simulations
- Create a json schema for atomic states, transitions and (maybe) input files
- Do docstrings and type hints in other files (got to calc_eff_rate_mats in core.py)
- Decide where things like calc_eff_rate_mats should go - in particular, how to deal with the question of full vs. partial rate equations (i.e. full set vs. Greenland-style)
- Make better names for each module
- Decide whether/how we're going to handle sources/sinks
- Decide whether/how we're going to handle impurity transport
- Remove petsc4py and MPI references
- Finish redistributing some of the tools functions into other modules so total number of modules can be released (e.g. physics_tools, matrix_utils)
- Check setup.py works now you've moved it up a directory
- Get a minimal working example (will need to do pip install -e SIKE first)
- Readme
- Tests
- Some demo scripts
- License
- Push to ICL repo
- Handle different velocity grids provided at input
- Work out how to deal with atomic data (mostly done)
